We are seeking 1-2 motivated PhD candidates for positions starting in Fall 2025. Students will explore topics such as urban heat dynamics, climate adaptation strategies, green infrastructure. This PhD will be granted by the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering (MAE) and will be a part of the [Urban Complex Systems track at NYU CUSP](https://engineering.nyu.edu/research-innovation/centers/cusp). In addition to working within NYU’s interdisciplinary research environment, students will have the unique opportunity to intern at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The successful candidate will receive full financial support, including tuition coverage, competitive stipends, and travel funding for conferences and internships.
