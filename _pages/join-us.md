**PhD Students**

We are seeking 1-2 PhD students to join the team starting in Fall 2025. The selected applicant will pursue a PhD granted by the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department, with a specialization in Urban complex system as part of the [Center of Urban Science and Progress](https://engineering.nyu.edu/research-innovation/centers/cusp). You will also have an opportunity to intern at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. If you're interested, please [apply to the NYU MAE PhD program](https://engineering.nyu.edu/admissions/graduate) and mention the Climate Resilient Cities lab in your application package. In addition, please reach out to me at ashreeva@caltech.edu with your CV and a cover letter. Your letter should clearly identify which aspect of our research resonates the most with you, and how do plan to advance the topic.
