**PhD Students**

We are seeking a highly-motivated PhD candidate to join our growing research team at the Urban Planet Lab. The research project will explore how people adapt to extreme heat in cities, and sits at the exciting intersection of complex systems, climate resilience, and urban remote sensing. The ideal fit for this role would be someone who:
- Has a strong background in engineering, math, or physics
- Has a transdisciplinary mindset
- Is comfortable with Python / R, geospatial analysis, or machine learning
- Is curious about urban systems, mobility data, and climate extremes
- Brings creativity, technical rigor, and a collaborative spirit.
- Experience with complexity science, remote sensing, urban climatology, or large-scale mobility datasets is a plus.
